# ARIMA Model

ARIMA is a combination of AR and MA models with differnece to make data stationary is represented as I

# Madras-Drinkingwater-level-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting drinking water levels in Madras using **time-series forecasting techniques**.  
The primary model applied is **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**, which combines autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA).
